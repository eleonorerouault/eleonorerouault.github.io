üåø I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of environmental, development, and health economics. My research uses survey, administrative and spatial data to focus on the health consequences of exposure to various environmental shocks, such as weather shocks or water pollution.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr/), working with the [Africooling](https://www.centre-cired.fr/africooling-2/) team on AC adoption determinants in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In my job market paper, I explore the very long-run effect of early life exposure to weather shocks on cognitive functions measured after 50 years old in rural China. 

I completed my PhD in economics at the University Paris-Dauphine, PSL (December 2024).
