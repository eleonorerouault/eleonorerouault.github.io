        <div class="description">
            This study examines the long-term effects of exposure to weather shocks from the in utero period to age 15 on cognition levels and cognitive decline. By matching data on cognitive measurements of rural Chinese individuals aged 50 to 80 years with meteorological conditions during their early childhood, the empirical strategy takes advantage of the random assignment of weather shocks. Although extensive literature has documented the immediate effects of environmental factors on early life health and human capital, this paper expands the analysis to a longer period of exposure and to outcomes measured during adulthood and old age. The findings underscore the critical influence of early childhood, from the prenatal period to age 4, on long-term cognitive outcomes. Experiencing a one-standard deviation increase in weather shocks from birth to age 4 results in a decrease in cognitive scores by 0.05 standard deviations after age 50, an effect comparable to the cognitive decline observed over 1.5 years of aging. The study shows that prenatal weather shocks lead to an accelerated latent decline in cognitive functions among males, observable after age 65. I document the mechanisms, highlighting reduced education following weather shocks.

        <div class="title">The effect of high temperature on seniors cognition: evidence from European countries (with E. Bonsang and C. Garrouste)</div>
        <div class="description">
            This study aims at investigating the effect of high temperatures on cognitive functions of individuals aged 50 and over. The empirical analysis exploits longitudinal data from the SHARE Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe which is combined with measures of daily temperature collected by ground weather stations. Our estimates are based on an individual fixed-effect strategy and show that high temperatures impede the cognitive functions. Our results reveal a stronger effect for poorer individuals, those aged over 65 years as well as those who are overweight. The poorest elderly are the more vulnerable to global warming, which impacts their working memory and fluency. This may affect their capacity to make complex decisions and, in turn, negatively affect their standard of living. Thus, our results suggest that global warming could amplify socio-economic inequalities.

        <div class="description">
            Indiaâ€™s substantial fertilizer consumption, a legacy of the Green Revolution, raises debates regarding its trade-offs between agricultural productivity and environmental and health concerns. Consumption of nitrate and nitrite has been linked to health issues like methemoglobinemia, a potentially fatal condition for infants. We utilize new data on agricultural practices, water pollution, and health outcomes to explore the relationship between fertilizer runoff, nitrogen concentration in water, and child mortality. In contrast to rivers, we document that nitrate levels in many groundwater sources surpass established standards. We find that nitrate concentrations exceeding the Indian government threshold correlate with a 9% increase in neonatal mortality and a 13% increase in child mortality. Finally, we provide evidence that, on average, exposure to nitrogen from fertilizers applied within the district of birth during the first trimester of pregnancy increases neonatal mortality by around 2%. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that this effect is higher for children born in households primarily drinking groundwater, as well as in households that do not treat drinking water and live in rural areas. However, we do not observe any effect of upstream exposure to nitrogen on downstream neonatal mortality. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the cost associated with neonatal mortality may surpass be
